Utilities for aufs2
http://aufs.sf.net
J. R. Okajima

These utilities are always necessary for aufs2.
If you forget to install them, your aufs may not work correctly.
And these are not for aufs1 essentially, except aubrsync. See below in
detail.

Makefile in this tree has some customizable make-variables.
- CPPFLAGS
  specify the include path if necessary.
  Some of linux kernel header files are necessary including
  linux/aufs_type.h. If you have installed kernel header files to
  /usr/include, then you may not need to specify CPPFLAGS.
  Otherwise you need to do something like this sample.
  + run "make headers_install" in your kernel source tree, and
    $LinuxSrc/usr/include is created and header files are installed
    there.
  + if you build aufs2 as module from aufs2-standalone.git, then
    $Aufs2Stdalone/usr/include is created and header files are
    installed there.
  + and specify
	CPPFLAGS="-I $LinuxSrc/usr/include -I $Aufs2Stdalone/usr/include"

- DESTDIR
  specify your install path if necessary.
  some commands have to be installed under /sbin.

o /sbin/mount.aufs, /sbin/umount.aufs
  Helpers for util-linux-ng package. You should NOT invoke them
  manually. Just install them by "make install".

o /sbin/auplink
  Handles aufs pseudo-link at remount/unmount time. You can invoke it
  manually at anytime.

o /usr/bin/auchk
  Similar to generic fsck. Checks whether a branch is healthy or not
  from aufs's point of view.

o /usr/bin/aubrsync
  Move files from the upper writable branch to the lower branch.
  If you use this script with aufs1, then you need to install aufs.shlib
  to /usr/lib/aufs.shlib. Currently only the 20080211 version is tested
  for aufs1.
  The development of this script is sponcered by ASUSTek Computer Inc.
  (http://www.asus.com/).
  Kindly they agreed that I keep my aufs work as free software as it has
  been.

o /etc/default/aufs
  A library for shell scripts.

o /usr/lib/libau.so
  A dynamic link library for "readdir(3) in user-space".
  If you need this , then run "make libau.so install_ulib". And refer to
  the aufs manual in detail.
